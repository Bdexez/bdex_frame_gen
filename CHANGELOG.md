## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-12

First release.

### Added

- Implicit Vulkan layer `VK_LAYER_BDEX_framegen`, enabled with `BDEX_FG=1`,
  which virtualises the game's swapchain and presents intermediate frames
  (x2, x3 or x4 multiplier).
- GPU motion estimation: luma pyramid (R16F when the driver supports it),
  hierarchical 8×8 forward and backward block matching with a bias toward
  zero motion, 3×3 median filter, 4×4 block refinement.
- Intermediate frame synthesis by bidirectional warping with a fixed-point
  search of the source position, weighting by photometric consistency,
  cross-fade in unexplained regions and scene cut detection (thresholds
  measured on the demo).
- Presentation from a dedicated thread on a compute queue separate from the
  game's; pacing of generated frames in mailbox / immediate modes; mailbox +
  pacing fallback when the queue has to be shared.
- Support for the RGBA/BGRA 8-bit (UNORM and sRGB), A2B10G10R10,
  A2R10G10B10 and RGBA16F swapchain formats; transparent pass-through of
  other formats and of multi-layer or protected swapchains.
- Forwarding of `VK_KHR_present_id`, of `VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1`
  present fences and present mode switches, and of
  `vkReleaseSwapchainImagesEXT`; handling of `oldSwapchain` (the old
  swapchain is retired before being replaced).
- Configuration through `BDEX_FG_*` variables and the
  `~/.config/bdex-framegen.conf` file with per-game sections (`[Game.exe]`).
- `flow`, `split` and `passthrough` debug modes, periodic statistics,
  per-stage GPU profiling (`PROFILE`), export of the presented frames
  (`DUMP`).
- GLFW demo application (`bdex_demo`) with a procedural scene, frame counter,
  deterministic mode, adjustable scene cuts and speed.
- Unit tests (configuration, formats), end-to-end test (doubled output frame
  rate) and quality evaluation tool (`tools/run_eval.sh`, PSNR against a
  60 fps reference).
- `tools/install.sh` / `tools/uninstall.sh` scripts (64-bit and 32-bit),
  `bdex-framegen` launcher with a `--check` option.

### Fixed

- Dispatch pointer of objects created by the layer (queue, command buffers),
  without which layers below it (Khronos validation) aborted.
- Shaders compiled for SPIR-V 1.0 so that Vulkan 1.0 applications (`vkcube`)
  are accepted.
- Swapchain image layout transition ordered after the acquire semaphore's
  wait stage (synchronization validation).
